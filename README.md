# ikebana
It's a service on delivery of bouquets, not finished. Used Vue.
To run the project you need vue-cli, use the command npm run dev. If you use command npm run build and open html file, image will not available, wrong way! :cold_sweat: I used webpack-simple when init project. Please correct the rules in webpack if you know how to :relaxed:
